fba-solution-pack-measurement ===========================

[work in progress] An Islandora Solution pack for the DEFRA DTC archive 
project, a collaborative project involving the Freshwater Biological 
Association and the Centre for e-Research at King's College London. The 
FBA Measurement Solution Pack allows users to create new Measurement objects
(see DTC archive data model), uploading attached CSV files to the DTC 
archive repository, then checks the validity of those CSV files against 
the DTC archive specified formats and generates RDF relating to the 
content of the CSV files.
